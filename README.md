# [Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC)](https://github.com/PIFSC-NMFS-NOAA)

The [Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/pacific-islands-fisheries-science-center) administers and conducts scientific research and monitoring programs that produce science to support the conservation and management of fisheries and living marine resources. We conduct research on fisheries and ocean ecosystems and the communities that depend on them throughout the Pacific Islands region, and by dedicating efforts to the recovery and conservation of protected species. The Center is organized into five major divisions: Operations, Management, and Information Division; Science Operations Division; Fisheries Research and Monitoring Division; Protected Species Division; and Ecosystem Sciences Division.

## List of Projects (by division/program when applicable):
- ### PIFSC Data Enterprise:
  - [Data Validation Module (DVM)](https://github.com/PIFSC-NMFS-NOAA/PIFSC-DataValidationModule)
    - Description: The DVM was developed to provide a framework to validate data entered in a given Oracle database based on flexible data validation criteria.  The module provides a documented, repeatable method for evaluating data quality control (QC) criteria on a given data set.  This module formally addresses the assurance phase of the data life cycle and addresses the transparency objective defined in the NOAA Data Strategy.  
  - [Database Logging Module (DLM)](https://github.com/PIFSC-NMFS-NOAA/PIFSC-DBLoggingModule)
    - Description: The DLM was developed to provide a method to log entries in an Oracle database for any modules that utilize an Oracle database.  
  - [Database Version Control Module (VCM)](https://github.com/PIFSC-NMFS-NOAA/PIFSC-DBVersionControlModule)
    - Description: The VCM was developed to provide a safe and easy way to install and upgrade database modules deployed on a given Oracle database instance.  The VCM provides information on which database module versions were installed and when they were installed on a database instance.  This module is used to apply the necessary database upgrades in the correct order to upgrade a given database module to a desired version.
